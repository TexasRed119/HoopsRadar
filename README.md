# HoopsRadar

'examples' has two examples of the court mapping, both which are in the presentation

The google colab file includes the first HoopsRadar section (which contains the HoopRadar class for inference) and the following sections which was some of my code during training and model creation.

'data' folder contains several past examples from past models, the data sets used to fine-tune the YOLO models, and the results/visualizations of the models.
